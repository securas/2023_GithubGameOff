## Failed 2023 GithubGameOff Gamejam Project
Unfortunately, I have no chance to finish this project in time.
Nevertheless, I would like to share it with whomever may need it.
Please consider the entire project MIT and assets CC0.

I hope it helps you make games!

A few notes:
- This was made with Godot 4.2 release candidate 1. I can't ensure compativility with newer or older versions.
- I've also used LDtk 1.4.1
- In the world scene (world.tscn) you can move the player to any location in the game map. This will be the starting location when in debug mode.
- In this form, the game loads all levels to the background. With many levels, this may be too much of a memory requirement.
